# htmlTest
From 20.04.2015, I began to learn web designing technologies. The first one is html, and many others 
are following, such as CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL etc. The reason for transfering my interest to web 
is that I got some ideas to change our internet cultures. The way we reading, we connecting with 
each other and the way we mining on internet are totally fall behind our time. We are wild men 
in a modern and big city. 

add something new.
