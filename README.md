# htmlTest
From 20.04.2015, I began to learn web design technologies. The first one is html, and many others 
are following, such as CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL etc. The reason for my transfering on my 
interest is that I got some ideas to change our internet cultures. The way we read, we connect with 
each other and the way we mine on internet are totally fall behind our enviroment. We are wild men 
in the modern big city. 

add something new.
